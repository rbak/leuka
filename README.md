An experiment for monitoring and response.  Rather than mapping specific responses to each alert, this was a general solution mapping monitoring alerts to further checks and recovery scripts even where the exact cause of the alert was not known.  This was accomplished using a network of relationships between the components meant to mimic the way a human might understand diagnose a system.  Created in 2015.
