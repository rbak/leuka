An experiment for monitoring and response.  Rather than mapping specific responses to each alert, this was a general solution mapping monitoring alerts to further checks and recovery scripts even where the exact cause of the alert was not known.  This was accomplished using a network of relationships between the components meant to mimic the way a human might understand and diagnose a system.

Testing was done using an OpenStack environment, and so some of the configs reference OpenStack concepts

Created in 2015.  Added here for my own reference.
