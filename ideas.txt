 Fixes
 - Better search heuristics
 - Thread safety
 - Handle shutdown in all threads


 Shortterm Goals
 - Output types (Include web)
 - Input types (Include icinga and monasca)


 Longterm Goals
 - Logging
 - Distributed/multinode
 - Actions and action level
 - Add threading to checks (multiple at once)
 - Neighbor support for checks





 For now
  - Add web output (Allow for multiple outputs)
  - Improve incident handling
  - Improve heuristics
  - Fully configure
  - Add icinga input monitor
  - daemonize

Output information
 - Summary vs Full information
 - Notify
   - Failed checks
   - Run checks
   - Discovered information (logs)
   - Triggers
   - Probable cause
   - Recommended actions
     - safety of actions
   - Incident Open/Closed
 - Poll
   - Explored Nodes
   - Failing nodes (Allow output to poll?)
   - Total nodes
   - Overall confidence?
   - Overall suspicion?
